# Responsive Relay

In this exercise, youâ€™ll be collaborating on a single webpage with multiple viewports. Each student will be responsible for designing a particular viewport threshold.

1. Pull the latest code from the collaborative Github repo
2. Write your responsive code within the relevant media query for you
3. Verify that your code is working as expected
4. Label your commit with your name and viewport
i.e. ` Marie: viewport 1600` and push to Git Hub
5. Slack message the student next in line

### Rules
- Only change the code within your own `media query`, not others
- You may right as many rules as you like within the `media query`
- You may add a `class` onto an HTML element, but you may not remove it
- Complete your changes within the designated times
